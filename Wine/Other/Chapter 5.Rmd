Objects passed along the pipeline and the functions acting on them carry some assumptions about their context.
  - Donâ€™t have to keep specifying the name of the underlying data frame object you are working from. Everything is implicitly carried forward from gss_sm.
  - Within the pipeline, the transient or implicit objects created from your summaries and other transformations are carried through, too.
```{r echo=FALSE}
rel_by_region <- gss_sm %>%
  group_by(bigregion, religion) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(freq = count / sum(count), pct = round(freq * 100, 0)) %>%
  drop_na(religion)

p <- ggplot(rel_by_region, aes(x = bigregion, y = pct, fill = religion))
p + geom_col(position = "dodge2") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = 'Percent', fill = "Religion") +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  coord_flip() +
  facet_grid( ~ bigregion)
### THE ABOVE PRODUCES THE WRONG PLOT because 'x' is still 'bigregion' and we don't need that since 'facet_wrap()' will seperate the charts for us by 'bigregion'
### 

p <- ggplot(rel_by_region, aes(x = religion, y = pct, fill = religion))
p + geom_col(position = "dodge2") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = 'Percent', fill = "Religion") +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  coord_flip() +
  facet_grid( ~ bigregion)
```

## ORGAN DATASET

p = ggplot(organdata, aes(reorder(country, donors, na.rm=TRUE), donors, fill=world))
p + geom_boxplot() +
  coord_flip()
  
```

```{r}
# Plotting the points like this leads to overplotting in many cases.
p = ggplot(organdata, aes(reorder(country, donors, na.rm=TRUE), donors, color=world))
p + geom_point() +
  coord_flip()
# May use geom_jitter to scatter the points a little bit to get a better idea of the data
# The default jitter is too much so decrease it jitter
p + geom_jitter(position=position_jitter(width = 0.15))+
  coord_flip()
```
